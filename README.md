## Need help?
Open an issue and I'll get to it when I can, unfortunately since this is a side project progress may be slow

##### Suport the project:

I just made this in my free time for an upcoming project, so no need to give me anything, but I would encourage you to send support towards [the original Polyglot team](https://github.com/mclemente/fvtt-module-polyglot) instead.
